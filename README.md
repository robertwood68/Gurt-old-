[Gurt](https://github.com/robertwood68/Gurt) is an introductory programming language that is being created to help students who have no programming experience learn to write code easily and understand the basics of data types, operations, and functions.

The language is currently still being developed but the initial draft has been laid out and a compiler is being created using Python to compile a user-specified Gurt program file to an equivalent MIPS assembly file, which then can be run in Visual Studio Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (to open command pallet) and running the "MARS: Assemble and run" command using the [MARScode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akainth015.marscode) extension or by opening the created file in the [MARS MIPS Simulator](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm) created by Missouri State University and pressing F3 to assemble the code and F5 to run it.
