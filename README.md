Gurt is an introductory programming language that is being created to help students who have no programming experience learn to write code easily and understand the basics of data types, operations, and functions.

The language is currently still being developed but the initial draft has been laid out and a compiler is being created using Python to compile a user-specified Gurt program file to an equivalent MIPS assembly file, which then can be run using the MARSCode extension for Visual Studio Code founded [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akainth015.marscode), or by using the MARS MIPS simulator by Missouri State University that can be found [here](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm).
